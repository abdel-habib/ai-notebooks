This repository is an attempt to deconstruct and understand various machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures, while also exploring essential functions and applied statistical learning theories.

Most foundational concepts will be built from scratch to emphasize the underlying theory, with minimal reliance on pre-built PyTorch components. The remaining implementations will use Python 3 and PyTorch for future reference.

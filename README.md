This repository will be an attempt to deconstruct and understand several ML algorithms and DL architectures, with also touching several essential functions and applied statistical learning theories. 

Most of the basic concepts will be built from scratch to understand the theories behind, relying less on pre-built PyTorch imports. The rest of the work will be implemented in Python 3 and PyTorch for future reference.
